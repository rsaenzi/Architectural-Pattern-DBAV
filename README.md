### Main Goal
Explore, investigate, design, test and develop an experimental Software Architectural Pattern that I named **DBAV: Data-Models Business-Rules Access-Controllers View-Managers**, and make it suitable for any mobile development.

### Motivation
This project was created just to serve as a Base Project for future mobile developments and as Laboratory Test for proposals about new software engineering techniques and use of best programming practices, in order to to improve my skills and become a Mobile Architect in a near future.

### Objetives
* Design and implement a the DBAV architectural pattern
* Create a consistent folder structure
* List all controllers that a mobile app could have
* Design a template for a Business Rules
* Design an data flow that connects all components
* Generate a Data Model to test the DBAV pattern
* Define how to test properly the DBAV components

### Software Tools
* **iOS 9.X** as target operating system  
* **Swift 2** as programming language  
* **XCode** as integrated development environment
* **CocoaPods** as dependency manager for third-party libraries

### Third-Party Libraries
* Alamofire: https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire
* SwiftyJSON: https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON
